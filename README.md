# AI-From-Zero-To-Hired
# 🚀 AI-From-Zero-To-Hired

Welcome to my 30-day journey from basics to job‑ready skills in **AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science**.  
Every day I spend 30–45 minutes learning a focused topic, practicing through Jupyter Notebooks, and pushing my work here.  
This repository is both my learning log and a free open resource for others!

---

## 📅 Schedule
✅ **Duration:** 30 days  
✅ **Goal:** Build strong foundations in ML/AI and create a portfolio to crack an entry-level Data Science/ML job.
